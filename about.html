                                <p>Integrity by definition is the quality of being honest, having strong moral principles, and being morally upright. Not everyone possesses this quality and not every service is bound to this trait. To do the right thing to others and to be proper is sometimes a nuisance to some. Usually, people would go for something easy to get the job done even though it is the wrong thing. However, doing something right and proper no matter the hardships and process is worth appreciating. To value the truth and being honest is another way of preventing a mistake to turn into a failure. Honesty is an expensive gift; don't expect it from cheap people. No matter what the situation, being able to do the right thing will always be the better choice in order to gain both trust and always be the better choice in order to gain both trust and best results.</p>

                                <h1 class="fs-2">INTEGRITY: WE ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING</h1>
                                <p>Being positive is having the good, affirmative, or constructive quality or attribute. A positive mindset often leads to positive results despite being in a negative situation. Usually, when it comes to equations in mathematics, the answer to a given problem would carry the sign of the bigger number. If people tend to focus on the bad side of everything, then it would be guide the very essence of a person's mind to the path of hopelessness. When there's no hope there's no positivity. Being negative only makes the tough journey more difficult. Being positive makes a difference as long as you put your mind to it. So no matter how hopeless, always carry on with the task and situation with pride believing you can achieve the goal. Never leave everything to fate, because we have the freedom to make our own destiny. Never let negativity rule over you, because we have the freedom to be positive in everything that we do. Remember, keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow.</p>

                                <p>When people set expectations from you, they wouldn't be surprised because obviously, they were expecting it. People and society would often say do this and that but when you fail they will be disappointed and would not expect more from you. Sometimes, staying in our comfort zone is like being in an escalator going down while you're moving upwards at a slow pace which ends up taking you nowhere. If you stop moving, you'd be dragged down. We are so accustomed to what we do that it became our lifestyle without trying new things, leaving behind unknown possibilities of learning and improvements. There's nothing to discover and to learn if you stay in place. What do we do? To F.A.I.L. means "First Attempt In Learning". You are your own limit.</p>

                                <p>According to <b class="fw-bolder">Proverbs 27:17</b>, "As Iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another." It is never good to be alone; it never was in the first place. There's no such thing us as "One Man Army". If you try to be on your own along the journey, you'd have no one to lean on, cry on, and talk to. You won't have anyone to share your problems with, and no one to correct you when you made a mistake. You'd be learning from your own experience only and not from other people's experience and journeys. “When a certain empire is attacked from outside sources, it can still rise up from the ashes.” But when an empire crumbles from within, it wouldn't have any chance of getting back up. That is why having even only just one friend is important. Putting others first before yourself is a true act of selflessness. In order to fortify a certain team, one must have trust, cooperation, and understanding within the group. Knowing that you have personal troubles, you'd be making the team a priority to make sure that the group would stand firm with a willingness to help as a foundation. The strength of the team is each individual member, and the strength of each member is the team.</p>

                                <h1 class="fs-2">RESULTS OVER EXCUSES</h1>
                                <p>When proud people fail at a certain subject or objective, they would often try to find an escape hole or reason their way out to make sure they don't embarrass themselves in their current situation. This type of mindset would make people believe that poor quality of work is okay as long as the reason is valid and acceptable. This makes bad progress in a certain group or team who is trying to meet a quota that was set for them by their superior. In order to meet the said demand, one must try his or her best to turn that “reasoned-out-work” to be accepted and approved. People usually stop when they see a dot of negativity without seeing the blank positivism of a whole paper. Like a plant attacked by pests with worn-out leaves left with little life, a farmer must put special care and treatment for it to stay alive, and so does a worker with his works. One must believe that troubles and aggravations are not hindrances to fruitful work. You can have excuses or results, but you can't have both. The Choice is yours. But remember, excuses don't get your results.</p>
